Installation
============

*refellips* has been tested on Python 3.7. As *refellips* utilises the same
*refnx* codebase, the refnx package and it's dependencies must be also
installed.

The refellips wheels are readily available on PyPI for Windows and Mac OS.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

  pip install refellips
