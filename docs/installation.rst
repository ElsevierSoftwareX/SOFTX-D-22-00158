Installation
============

*refellips* has been tested on Python 3.8, 3.9. As *refellips* utilises the same
*refnx* codebase, the refnx package and it's dependencies must be also
installed.

The refellips wheels are readily available on PyPI, it is a pure Python package.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

  pip install refellips
