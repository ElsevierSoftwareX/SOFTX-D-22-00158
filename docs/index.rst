`refellips`_ is a Python package designed for the analysis of variable
angle spectroscopic ellipsometry data. It is a flexible package, built around
the widely used `refnx`_ package used extensively in the analysis of neutron
and X-ray reflectivity data.

The package makes use of `TMM`_ package written by `Steven Byrnes`_ to
calculate ellipsometric parameters. The physics background behind those
calculations can be found `here`_

Demonstrations of refellips are available here as well as on the `GitHub
repository`_.

The refellips package is free software distributed under the BSD 3-clause
license. If you are interested in participating in this project, please
use the `GitHub repository`_; all contributions are welcomed.
